# Spacecraft Thermal Design 
This course introduces the fundamentals of spacecraft thermal control, focusing on heat transfer principles, system design, and analysis. Students will learn to model thermal systems using ESATAN-TMS and explore key hardware and design strategies essential for space missions.

## Learning Objectives
LO1 Understand the spacecraft thermal environment
LO2 Define the thermal subsystem and compare the different hardware options.
LO3 Understand the design cycle of the thermal subsystem.
LO4 Apply the concepts of heat transfer (radiation, conduction), heat balance and heat flows
LO5 Generate and use analytical thermal analysis models 
LO6 Generate and use numerical thermal analysis models
