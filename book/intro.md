# Spacecraft Thermal Design 
This course provides a foundational understanding of space thermal control systems, including key hardware components, system design methodologies, and analysis techniques.  
Building on core principles of heat transfer, particularly radiation and conduction, the course explores the methods and tools used in the thermal design of spacecraft.

## Learning Objectives
LO1 Understand the spacecraft thermal environment.  
LO2 Define the thermal subsystem and compare the different hardware options.  
LO3 Understand the design cycle of the thermal subsystem.  
LO4 Apply the concepts of heat transfer (radiation, conduction), heat balance and heat flows.  
LO5 Generate and use analytical thermal analysis models.  
LO6 Generate and use numerical thermal analysis models.
