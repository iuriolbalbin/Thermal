# Thermal Control Objectives 

Spacecraft operate in environments with extreme and variable temperatures, which can significantly impact system performance and reliability. The following points highlight why thermal control, analysis, and engineering are essential for a successful space mission:

**Operational Temperature Ranges**: Spacecraft equipment only functions properly within specific temperature limits. For example, batteries may lose charge if they become too cold or could overheat and explode. Similarly, propulsion system fuel or thermal system fluids can freeze if temperatures drop too low.

**Temperature Gradients**: Managing temperature differences across the spacecraft is also important. Uneven temperatures can cause deformation, which is especially critical in precision systems like optical instruments, as it can affect measurement accuracy. Additionally, temperature gradients can introduce mechanical stresses, particularly at bonded interfaces which can potentially lead to structural failure.  

**Material Fatigue**: Repeated temperature swings can lead to material fatigue over time, compromising the integrity of spacecraft components.  

**Material Property Changes**: Extreme temperatures can alter material properties. For instance, adhesives may outgas at high temperatures, and materials can become brittle under cryogenic conditions.  

**Performance-Dependent Temperatures**: Certain systems require specific temperature conditions for optimal performance. For example, solar cells operate more efficiently at lower temperatures, sensors generate less noise when cooler, and a 3D printer must heat materials to their melting point to function properly.  

## Temperature Ranges
During your time as thermal engineer you will encounter references to specific temperature ranges. 
The exact definition can differ but in general: The high temperature range considers temperature above 470K, and the cryogenic temperature range considers temperatures below 200K. 
Other important temperature to remember is 77 K = -196 Â°C which is the boiling point of nitrogen. Many cold tests are cooled with nitrogen. This means testing close to or lower than this boiling temperature is a lot more difficult. 

## Thermal Requirements
The needs of a space mission can be converted into thermal requirements that are later passed on to the thermal subsystem. The number of systems requirements depend on whether an active or a passive system is required. An active system needs power and communications from the satellite bus. A passive system will always work. 

A requirement can be defined as: 

* *Temperature range*, both for operations and qualification: These requirements are defined to keep system in their survival or operational range. This is to secure the integrity of materials, an optimal functioning of parts and to keep parts within their tested range. 
* *Temperature gradients and uniformity*: These requirements are defined to keep a temperature uniform over a certain area. This is important for alignment of parts and internal stresses. Sometimes these requirements are defined to make sure any part of a system is within a small range from the point where the temperature is measured. 
* *Temperature stability*: These requirements are defined to keep temperatures uniform over time. This is important for sensors for example, and ensures measurements are taken in similar conditions. 
* *Interface heat flux and flows*: Interface requirements are defined to help the systems design. Often large missions are divided into different payloads/component and for integration it will be necessary to know the heat flux and flows between them. 

Other requirements onto the thermal system often include electrical power and other consumables (e.g. coolant that boils off), Telemetry (TM) and Telecommand (TC) data allocation, mass, limits on optical properties for a system, and of course the thermal environment, which will be discussed in the next section. The thermal environment will both define on-ground conditions and orbital conditions.
