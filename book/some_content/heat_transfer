## Types of heat transfer
Heat transfer deals with the transfer of the thermal energy between the environment and the spacecraft and between spacecraft elements. It is either expressed as a heat flow or as a heat flux. 
Heat Flow  is the transfer of thermal energy (heat) per unit time. This is denoted with the symbol a capital Q. This is a scaler and expressed in Watt (W=J/s).
Heat Flux is the transfer of thermal energy (heat) per unit time per unit area. This is denoted with a Î¦. The heat flux is a vector and expressed in W/m2 (=J/s/m2)


Three mechanisms of heat transfer are:
Conduction is the transfer of heat through molecular interactions. It occurs at contact points and within solid parts. This type of heat transfer is important at a local level within spacecraft systems.
Convection is the transfer of heat through the movement of gases or fluids. Although convection does not occur naturally in the vacuum of space, it can still be present in spacecraft systems such as fuel systems, heat pipes, or environments with human occupants. Convection can happen naturally or be forced by a device like a fan. It behaves differently in space compared to environments with gravity. On Earth, for example, warmer fluids rise because they are less dense than their surroundings, with gravity helping to drive the motion.
Radiation is the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves and does not require a medium. Heat moves directly from one surface to another. This is the primary mechanism of heat transfer in space and is also how energy from the sun and planets is transmitted.
 
In the next sections, all three mechanisms will be explained in more detail.
